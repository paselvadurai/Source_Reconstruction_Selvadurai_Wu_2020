  Abstract                 = {The history of the development of statistical hypothesis testing in time series analysis is reviewed briefly and it is pointed out that the hypothesis testing procedure is not adequately defined as the procedure for statistical model identification. The classical maximum likelihood estimation procedure is reviewed and a new estimate minimum information theoretical criterion (AIC) estimate (MAICE) which is designed for the purpose of statistical identification is introduced. When there are several competing models the MAICE is defined by the model and the maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters which give the minimum of AIC defined by AIC = (??Ã??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂ2)log- (maximum likelihood) + 2(number of independently adjusted parameters within the model). MAICE provides a versatile procedure for statistical model identification which is free from the ambiguities inherent in the application of conventional hypothesis testing procedure. The practical utility of MAICE in time series analysis is demonstrated with some numerical examples.},

  Abstract                 = {--- A simple and powerful method for simulating ground motions is to combine parametric or functional descriptions of the ground motion's amplitude spectrum with a random phase spectrum modified such that the motion is distributed over a duration related to the earthquake magnitude and to the distance from the source. This method of simulating ground motions often goes by the name ``the stochastic method.'' It is particularly useful for simulating the higher-frequency ground motions of most interest to engineers (generally, f>0.1 Hz), and it is widely used to predict ground motions for regions of the world in which recordings of motion from potentially damaging earthquakes are not available. This simple method has been successful in matching a variety of ground-motion measures for earthquakes with seismic moments spanning more than 12 orders of magnitude and in diverse tectonic environments. One of the essential characteristics of the method is that it distills what is known about the various factors affecting ground motions (source, path, and site) into simple functional forms. This provides a means by which the results of the rigorous studies reported in other papers in this volume can be incorporated into practical predictions of ground motion.},

Empirically known frequency of occurrence statistics, moment-magnitude relationships, and the constancy of earthquake stress drops may be used to infer that the number of earthquakes N of dimension ?Ã??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂ?r is of the form N ??Ã??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂ¼ 1/r2 and that the spectral composition of ?Ã??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂ??p(x, y) is of the form , where is the two-dimensional Fourier transform of ?Ã??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂ??p(x, y) expressed in radial wave number k. The ?Ã??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂ³ = 2 model of the far-field shear wave displacement spectrum is consistent with the spectral composition , provided that the number of contributions to the spectral representation of the radiated field at frequency Ã??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂ¯Ã??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂ goes as (k/k0)2, consistent with the quasi-static frequency of occurrence relation N ??Ã??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂ¼ 1/r2; k0 is a reference wave number associated with the reciprocal source dimension. Separately, a variety of seismologic observations suggests that the ?Ã??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂ³ = 2 model is the one generally, although certainly not always, applicable to the high-frequency spectral decay of the far-field radiation of earthquakes. In this framework, then, b values near 1, the general validity of the ?Ã??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂ³ = 2 model, and the constancy of earthquake stress drops independent of size are all related to the average spectral composition of . Should one of these change as a result of premonitory effects leading to failure, as has been specifically proposed for b values, it seems likely that one or all of the other characteristics will change as well from their normative values. Irrespective of these associations, the far-field, high-frequency shear radiation for the ?Ã??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂ³ = 2 model in the presence of anelastic attenuation may be interpreted as band-limited, finite duration white noise in acceleration. Its rms value, arms, is given by the expression arms = 0.85[21/2(2?Ã??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂ)2/106] (?Ã??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂ??/??R)(Ã??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂ¯Ã??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂmax/Ã??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂ¯Ã??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂ0)1/2, where ?Ã??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂ?? is the earthquake stress drop, ?? is density, R is hypocentral distance, Ã??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂ¯Ã??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂ0 is the spectral corner frequency, and Ã??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂ¯Ã??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂmax is determined by R and specific attenuation 1/Q. For several reasons, one of which is that it may be estimated in the absence of empirically defined ground motion correlations, arms holds considerable promise as a measure of high-frequency strong ground motion for engineering purposes.},

  Abstract                 = {A variety of geophysical observations suggests that the upper portion of the lithosphere, herein referred to as the elastic plate, has long-term material properties and frictional strength significantly greater than the lower lithosphere. If the average frictional stress along the non-ridge margin of the elastic plate is of the order of a kilobar, as suggested by the many observations of the frictional strength of rocks at mid-crustal conditions of pressure and temperature, the only viable mechanism for driving the motion of the elastic plate is a basal shear stress of several tens of bars. Kilobars of tectonic stress are then an ambient, steady condition of the earth's crust and uppermost mantle. The approximate equality of the basal shear stress and the average crustal earthquake stress drop, the localization of strain release for major plate margin earthquakes, and the rough equivalence of plate margin slip rates and gross plate motion rates suggest that the stress drops of major plate margin earthquakes are controlled by the elastic release of the basal shear stress in the vicinity of the plate margin, despite the existence of kilobars of tectonic stress existing across vertical planes parallel to the plate margin. If the stress differences available to be released at the time of faulting are distributed in a random, white fasbion with a mean-square value determined by the average earthquake stress drop, the frequency of occurrence of constant stress drop earthquakes will be proportional to reciprocal faulting area, in accordance with empirically known frequency of occurrence statistics.},

  Abstract                 = {AbstractLarge variability of earthquake stress drops and scaled energy has been commonly reported in the literature, but it is difficult to assess how much of this variability is caused by underlying physical source processes rather than simply observational uncertainties. Here we examine a variety of dynamically realistic rupture scenarios for circular and elliptical faults and investigate to what extent the variability in seismically estimated stress drops and scaled energy comes from differences in source geometry, rupture directivity, and rupture speeds. We numerically simulate earthquake source scenarios using a cohesive-zone model with the small-scale yielding limit, where the solution approaches a singular crack model with spontaneous healing of slip. Compared to symmetrical circular source models, asymmetrical models result in larger variability of estimated corner frequencies and scaled energy over the focal sphere. The general behavior of the spherical averages of corner frequencies and scaled energy in the subshear regime extends to the supershear regime, although shear Mach waves generated by the propagation of supershear rupture lead to much higher corner frequency and scaled energy estimates locally. Our results suggest that at least a factor of 2 difference in the spherical average of corner frequencies is expected in observational studies simply from variability in source characteristics almost independent of the actual stress drops, translating into a factor of 8 difference in estimated stress drops. Furthermore, radiation efficiency estimates derived from observed seismic spectra should not be directly interpreted as describing rupture properties unless there are independent constraints on rupture speed and geometry.},

  Abstract                 = {The seismic moment is related by definition to the average slip on the fault plane of an earthquake. Here we derive an exact expression for the seismic moment in terms of a general heterogeneous stress drop distribution and the geometry of the fault of a complex event. We find that the seismic moment is proportional to a weighted integral of the stress drop on the fault. The weight in this linear relationship is the slip for a hypothetical event with the same source geometry but uniform stress drop. This relationship between seismic moment and stress drop depends on geometry. In particular, for multiple sources the weight is reduced by factors of the order of ??/R, where ?? is the radius of a typical subfault and R is the radius of the total source area. As a consequence of these results we find that for a given stress drop, a simple fault generates a larger seismic moment than a multiple fault of the same total surface. Conversely, for a given moment and source area, a complex event would need higher stress drops on the subfaults than a simple smooth fault. We test these results with three rectangular models of faulting. The first is a simple, smooth fault with uniform stress drop. The second model is a simple fault with zero stress drop in the central section of the fault. The last model is a complex event where the central section of the fault remains unbroken. We show that the last two models are difficult to distinguish from their far-field radiation.},

  Abstract                 = {We present a theory for the radiation of high-frequency waves by earthquake faults. We model the fault as a planar region in which the stress drops to the kinematic friction during slip. This model is entirely equivalent to a shear crack. For two-dimensional fault models we show that the high frequencies originate from the stress and slip velocity concentrations in the vicinity of the fault's edges. These stress concentrations radiate when the crack expands with accelerated motion. The most efficient generation of high-frequency waves occurs when the rupture velocity changes abruptly. In this case, the displacement spectrum has an ?Ã??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂ-2 behaviour at high frequencies. The excitation is proportional to the intensity of the stress concentration near the crack tips and to the change in the focusing factor due to rupture velocity. We extend these two-dimensional results to more general three-dimensional fault models in the case when the rupture velocity changes simultaneously on the rupture front. Results are similar to those described for two-dimensional faults. We apply the theory to the case of a circular fault that grows at constant velocity and stops suddenly. The present theory is in excellent agreement with a numerical solution of the same problem. Our results provide upper bounds to the high-frequency radiation from more realistic models in which rupture velocity does not change suddenly. The ?Ã??ÃÂÃ?ÂÃÂ-2 is the minimum possible decay at high frequencies for any crack model of the source.},

  abstract = {Three-dimensional analyses are reported of slip on a long vertical strike-slip fault between steadily driven elastic crustal blocks. A rate- and state-dependent friction law governs motion on the fault; the law includes a characteristic slip distance L for evolution of surface state and slip weakening. Because temperature and normal stress vary with depth, frictional constitutive properties (velocity weakening/strengthening) do also. Those properties are taken either as uniform along-strike at every depth or as perturbed modestly from uniformity. The governing equations of quasi-static elasticity and frictional slip are solved on a computational grid of cells as a discrete numerical system, and a viscous radiation damping term is included to approximately represent inertial control of slip rates during earthquake-like instabilities. The numerical results show richly complex slip, with a spectrum of event sizes, when solved for a grid with oversized cells, that is, with cell size h that is too large to validly represent the underlying continuous system of equations. However, in every case for which it has been feasible to do the computations (moderately large L only), that spatio-temporally complex slip disappears in favor of simple limit cycles of periodically repeated large earthquakes with reduction of cell size h. Further study will be necessary to determine whether a similar transition occurs when the elastodynamics of rupture propagation is treated more exactly, rather than in the radiation damping approximation. The transition from complex to ordered fault response occurs as h is reduced below a theoretically derived nucleation size h* which scales with L but is 2 Ã???Ã?ÂÃÂ 104 to 105 larger in cases considered. Cells larger than h* can fail independently of one another, whereas those much smaller than h* cannot slip unstably alone and can do so only as part of a cooperating group of cells. The results contradict an emergent view that spatio-temporal complexity is a generic feature of mechanical fault models. Such generic complexity does apparently result from models which are inherently discrete in the sense of having no well-defined continuum limit as h diminishes. Those models form a different class of dynamical systems from models like the present one that do have a continuum limit. Strongly oversized cells cause the model developed here to mimic an inherently discrete system. It is suggested that oversized cells, capable of failing independently of one another, may crudely represent geometrically disordered fault zones, with quasi-independent fault segments that join one another at kinks or jogs. Such geometric disorder, at scales larger than h*, may force a system with a well-defined continuum limit to mimic an inherently discrete system and show spatio-temporally complex slip at those larger scales.},

This paper examines the mechanics of a mated smooth interface that is subjected to a normal stress and where the contact is perturbed by a circular patch that can experience dilatancy under shear. The analysis of the static stress drop occurring during shear at the interface is examined using a contact mechanics approach that accounts for the separation at the pre-compressed geological interface induced by the development of dilatancy of the patch during relative shear. This paper presents an elementary model of the mechanics that takes into consideration the normal stress evolution during dilatant shearing of the interface. The problem is of particular interest to the modelling of local phenomena that can occur at material interfaces and geological faults that are subjected to steady movement.},
